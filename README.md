# 74-Orange-Opps

## We are Team 74 of mini FRC, the Orange Opps.

Our rookie season was 2024 and it was great! Here are some of our accomplishments at Mini FRC 10:
- Our alliance made it to the semifinals in the losers bracket in a double elimintaion tournement,
- We managed to be the first, and one of the only, team to climb on the stage,
- and we had the cleanest looking robot ~~*biased*~~.

## Design

We designed our robot heavily off of the robot that our team's team had competed and made worlds with for regular, full-sized FRC. Our workflow was in OnShape so you can easily view and download/3D print CAD [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/561065ee11688eb6314d06ba/w/829a4e28d8331633d6eed549/e/7dac9a85c5c0d4fed6ff8528?renderMode=0&uiState=66d23f52e866a03951123aa6).

## Code

Our code is based in Arduino IDE and runs on an ESP32 connected to a [NoU2 board](https://www.alfredosys.com/products/alfredo-nou2/) though we have plans to upgrade to a NoU3 when it comes out. I have been working with the code to implement an ultrasonic sensor that can detect how far away our robot is from the stage so that it can automatically aim and shoot from any point on our wing with no obstruction.
